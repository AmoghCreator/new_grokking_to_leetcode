# Mapping the new Grokking Coding Interview Patterns course (2022 - Python) to LeetCode 
[In-Progress. Pull Requests And Issues Appreciated]

[Mapping Website](https://navidre.github.io/new_grokking_to_leetcode/) | [Educative Signup Link](https://educative.io/signup?referralCode=nrezaeis-xVMKDGxYl5P) | [Course Link](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-patterns-python?referralCode=nrezaeis-xVMKDGxYl5P)

It is helpful to have all the progress and code in one place. Some prefer this place to be LeetCode. 
Grokking the Coding Interview has been a good course in the learning and problem-solving process. 
There already exist different gists mapping the older Grokking to Leetcode, such as [this gist](https://gist.github.com/tykurtz/3548a31f673588c05c89f9ca42067bc4).
Educative introduced a new version of this course in 2022. For people who want to have a gist mapping the new 2022 grokking
course to Leetcode, this gist can be helpful. This is a community effort, so additions and comments are appreciated.
